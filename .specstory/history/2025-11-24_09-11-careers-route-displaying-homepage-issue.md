# Careers route displaying homepage issue (2025-11-24 11:11:39)

_**User**_

The careers route /careers is showing the homepage, why?

I'll investigate why the `/careers` route is showing the homepage. Let me check the relevant routing files.

I found the issue! The problem is with the middleware matcher configuration. Your routing uses `localePrefix: 'as-needed'`, which means paths without a locale prefix (like `/careers`) should work for the default locale ('he'). However, your middleware matcher is only catching paths with explicit locale prefixes.

The current matcher:

```6:9:/Users/bodokh/projects/ai-crafters/src/middleware.ts
export const config = {
  // Match only internationalized pathnames
  matcher: ['/', '/(he|en)/:path*']
};
```

This only matches `/`, `/he/*`, and `/en/*`, but not `/careers`. Let me fix this:

Perfect! I've updated the middleware matcher to include paths without locale prefixes. The new matcher pattern:
- `/` - root path
- `/(he|en)/:path*` - explicit locale paths like `/he/careers` or `/en/careers`  
- `/((?!_next|_vercel|.*\\..*).*)` - all other paths (like `/careers`) except Next.js internals and static files

This means `/careers` will now be properly handled as a route with the default locale ('he'), and the careers page should display correctly instead of showing the homepage.

The issue was that with `localePrefix: 'as-needed'` in your routing config, the middleware needs to catch both prefixed and non-prefixed paths, but your previous matcher was only catching paths with explicit locale prefixes.
