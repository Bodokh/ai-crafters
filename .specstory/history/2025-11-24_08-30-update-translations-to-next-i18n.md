# Update translations to next i18n (2025-11-24 10:30:55)

_**User**_

Please replace our translations to use next i18n instead of our current translations. 



See next.conig.ts i added the plugin but i did not migrate the code yet

I'll help you migrate from your custom translation system to next-intl. Let me first examine your current setup to understand the translation structure and implementation.

I can see your current setup with custom translations in `LanguageContext.tsx`. Before I create a migration plan, I need to clarify a few implementation details:

1. Your `next.config.ts` references `./src/i18n/request.ts`, but your project doesn't have a `src` folder. Should I:
   - a) Keep the flat structure and use `./i18n/request.ts` (update next.config.ts)
   - b) Create a `src` folder structure

2. Which routing approach do you prefer?
   - a) URL-based locales (`/en/...` and `/he/...`) - next-intl's recommended approach with better SEO
   - b) Single route with client-side language switching (like your current setup)

3. Should English remain the default language?

Perfect! One more clarification:

3. Should English remain the default language?
   - a) Yes, English (`en`) as default
   - b) Hebrew (`he`) as default

New app file structure should be as follows:

├── messages

│   ├── en.json

│   └── ...

├── next.config.ts

└── src

    ├── i18n

    │   └── request.ts

    └── app

        ├── layout.tsx

        └── page.tsx

Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

I'll implement the migration plan step by step. Let me start by marking the first todo as in progress and creating the translation files.

```

```
cp: /Users/bodokh/projects/ai-crafters/src/app/globals.css: No such file or directory

```

---



---

```bash
mkdir -p /Users/bodokh/projects/ai-crafters/src/app && cp /Users/bodokh/projects/ai-crafters/app/globals.css /Users/bodokh/projects/ai-crafters/src/app/globals.css
```

---



---



---



---



---

```bash
cp -r /Users/bodokh/projects/ai-crafters/components /Users/bodokh/projects/ai-crafters/src/
```

---



---



---

Now let me update the components to use next-intl. I'll start with AppContent:

Now let me clean up the old files and directories:

---

Remove old layout file from app directory

---

Remove old page file from app directory

---

Remove old providers file from app directory

---

Remove old globals.css from app directory

---

```bash
rm -rf /Users/bodokh/projects/ai-crafters/components /Users/bodokh/projects/ai-crafters/contexts /Users/bodokh/projects/ai-crafters/app
```

---



---



---

```bash
cd /Users/bodokh/projects/ai-crafters && find src -type f -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" | head -20
```

```
src/middleware.ts
src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx
src/app/[locale]/page.tsx
src/app/layout.tsx
src/components/Projects.tsx
src/components/TechStack.tsx
src/components/Hero.tsx
src/components/Navbar.tsx
src/components/AppContent.tsx
src/components/Contact.tsx
src/components/Services.tsx
src/components/Footer.tsx
src/components/Testimonials.tsx
src/components/Process.tsx
src/i18n/routing.ts
src/i18n/request.ts

```

---



---

Perfect! Now let me check for any linting errors in the key files:

---



---



---

```bash
cd /Users/bodokh/projects/ai-crafters && yarn build 2>&1 | head -50
```

Looks like the custom tailwind.config.ts is not appearing in the final product, the text-brand-500 and other classes are not working in the website (no class exists)

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Let me check your tailwind.config.ts to see what custom classes are defined and verify the content paths are correct for the new structure:

---

Read file: undefined

---



---

Found the issue! The `tailwind.config.ts` content paths are still pointing to the old directory structure. They need to be updated to point to the new `src/` directory:

---



---



---



---

Perfect! I've updated the Tailwind configuration to point to the new `src/` directory structure. The custom classes like `text-brand-500`, `bg-brand-600`, etc. should now work properly.

## Migration Complete! ✅

All todos have been completed. Here's a summary of what was done:

### ✅ Changes Made:

1. **Created translation files** (`messages/en.json` and `messages/he.json`) with all translations extracted from the old LanguageContext

2. **Set up next-intl configuration**:
   - `src/i18n/request.ts` - i18n configuration with Hebrew as default
   - `src/i18n/routing.ts` - routing configuration with navigation helpers
   - `src/middleware.ts` - middleware for locale detection and routing

3. **Restructured app directory**:
   - Created `src/app/layout.tsx` (root layout with NextIntlClientProvider)
   - Created `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` (locale-specific layout)
   - Created `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx` (locale-specific page)
   - Moved `globals.css` to `src/app/`

4. **Migrated all components** to `src/components/`:
   - Replaced `useLanguage()` with `useTranslations()` and `useLocale()`
   - Updated Navbar to use locale-based routing with `useRouter()` and `usePathname()` from `@/i18n/routing`
   - Maintained RTL support for Hebrew

5. **Updated configuration**:
   - Updated `tsconfig.json` to point `@/*` to `./src/*`
   - **Fixed `tailwind.config.ts`** to scan `./src/` directories instead of root directories

6. **Cleaned up**:
   - Removed old `app/`, `components/`, and `contexts/` directories
   - Deleted old LanguageContext

### 🌐 How it works now:

- **Default route** (`/`) → Hebrew content (default locale)
- **English route** (`/en`) → English content
- Language switcher in Navbar uses `router.replace()` to change locales
- RTL automatically applied for Hebrew, LTR for English
- All translations loaded from JSON files via next-intl

The migration is complete! You should be able to run your dev server now and see the site working with next-intl routing.

Still i dont see my cistm theme extend colors. The brand colors are not existing in the final css, the rest of the built-in tailwind classes work

Let me check if there's a caching issue or if the Tailwind config needs to be regenerated. Let me read the current config to verify it's correct:

---

Read file: undefined

---

```bash
cd /Users/bodokh/projects/ai-crafters && rm -rf .next && echo "Cleared .next cache"
```

```
Cleared .next cache

```

---



---

Let me check your PostCSS config and globals.css to ensure Tailwind is properly configured:

Ah! I see the issue now. You're using **Tailwind CSS v4** (`^4.1.17`), which has a completely different configuration system. In Tailwind v4, you don't use `tailwind.config.ts` anymore - instead, you define your theme directly in CSS using the `@theme` directive.

Let me convert your configuration to Tailwind v4 format:

---



---

```bash
cd /Users/bodokh/projects/ai-crafters && mv tailwind.config.ts tailwind.config.ts.backup
```

---



---

```bash
cd /Users/bodokh/projects/ai-crafters && rm -rf .next && echo "Cache cleared - ready for restart"
```

```
Cache cleared - ready for restart

```

---



---

Let me also update the PostCSS config to properly include the content paths for Tailwind v4:

---



---



---

Perfect! I've fixed the Tailwind configuration issue. Here's what was wrong and what I did:

## The Problem
You're using **Tailwind CSS v4** (`^4.1.17`), which has a completely different configuration system than v3. The old `tailwind.config.ts` file is **not used** in Tailwind v4.

## What I Fixed

### 1. **Converted to Tailwind v4 Configuration** 
In Tailwind v4, theme customization is done directly in CSS using the `@theme` directive. I've updated `src/app/globals.css` to include:

```css
@theme {
  --color-brand-50: #f0f9ff;
  --color-brand-100: #e0f2fe;
  --color-brand-200: #bae6fd;
  --color-brand-300: #7dd3fc;
  --color-brand-400: #38bdf8;
  --color-brand-500: #0ea5e9;
  --color-brand-600: #0284c7;
  --color-brand-700: #0369a1;
  --color-brand-800: #075985;
  --color-brand-900: #0c4a6e;
  --color-brand-950: #082f49;
  
  --color-accent-500: #8b5cf6;
  
  /* Custom animations */
  --animate-blob: blob 10s infinite;
  --animate-shimmer: shimmer 2s linear infinite;
  --animate-float: float 6s ease-in-out infinite;
  /* ... etc */
}
```

### 2. **Updated PostCSS Config**
Set the base directory to `./src` for proper content scanning.

### 3. **Backed Up Old Config**
Renamed `tailwind.config.ts` to `tailwind.config.ts.backup` (it's not needed in v4).

### 4. **Cleared Cache**
Removed `.next` directory to force a fresh build.

## Next Step
**Restart your dev server** (`yarn dev`) and all your custom brand colors should now work! Classes like `text-brand-500`, `bg-brand-600`, `border-brand-400`, etc. will be properly generated.

The cyan text instead of showing a static gradient the background position keeps animating in an awekard fashion. I just want to look like in the second photo, a gradient with no special gradient effects (other than the docding effect, thats good)

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I can see the issue - the animated shimmer effect on the gradient text. Let me remove the animation classes while keeping the static gradient:

---

Read file: undefined

---



---



---



---

Perfect! I've removed the `animate-shimmer` and `bg-300%` classes from the gradient text. Now you'll have:

✅ **Static gradient** (from cyan → brand → violet) like in your second photo
✅ **Decoding text effect** still working (the scrambling animation)
❌ No more awkward background position animation

The gradient will now look clean and static while the text decoding effect continues to work beautifully!
